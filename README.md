# <h1> Overview 
This is a 2-tier Python program that allows the user to keep track of movies in two seperate lists: a watch list and a seen list. All data is stored in a MySQL database. 

The GUI was desinged using PyQt5's Qt Designer, and the program uses the sql.connector to communicate with the MySQL. 

To connect to a SQL database, assign your creditanls to the respective variables in the dbConnect function of the DBConnection file. 

 ## <h3> Motivation
 I watch a *lot* of movies, so I wanted a way to keep track of the ones I've seen, and the ones I want to see.
